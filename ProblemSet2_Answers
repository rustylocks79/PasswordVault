1) A description of how you are using symmetric key encryption,
including how you are sharing the keys used in encrypting exported passwords.

    We are using a single key/IV pair to encrypt all of our passwords in the plaintext file, when we want to
    share an account we create an entirely new key/IV pair to encrypt the data and send with the file

2) A revised list of vulnerabilities (1 page maximum).

    If a hacker has the master password then they have access to all the passwords and usernames that the user has
    stored. Not only that but, the usernames and passwords have an id telling the hacker exactly where to use the
    passwords. That means access to bank accounts, social media and more. Also, if the hacker had the master password,
    they could change any of the userâ€™s information which would compromise the integrity of the data.
    Next, passwords are stored as strings in the program
    so if someone dumped the memory, they could see the strings in plain text and could probably guess
    which strings are passwords.
    Next, we have no limit on the number of tries to enter the master password. A hacker could
    try a brute force attack on the master password.
    If our text file storing the data is changed, the user might not be able to access their information.
    If an id is changed then they can't retrieve the password and username. Or, if the master password is
    changed all hope is lost for the user.
    Lastly, the user enters their password in plain text. Anyone watching their screen would then know
    their password too. As you can see, confidentiality is a problem with this password vault.
