    answer...

5) How might the risk that you face change over time?  Specifically address the two components of risk.

    Both aspects of risk will increase over time. Probability of an attack will increase because as the vault
    is used there is a higher chance a potential attacker will know about it. Impact of an attack will also
    increase over time because the number of passwords stored in the vault will continue to increase,
    meaning that anyone who gains access will have far more information available to them
